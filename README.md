👋 Hi, I’m Kazi Nafiul Hassan
🚀 AI Researcher | Data Scientist | Environmental Engineer

🌍 About Me
I am a Research Project Engineer at Magdeburg-Stendal University of Applied Sciences, specializing in Artificial Intelligence in waste management under the SMART TRASH project. My work focuses on AI-driven solutions for environmental education, waste separation, and robotics, leveraging GPR radar, multilingual databases, and automation technologies.

Previously, I contributed to the RENO-TITAN project, where I developed statistical data models and user-interactive web applications for sustainable environmental management. My expertise spans across:
✅ Machine Learning & AI (Pytorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)
✅ Data Science & Analysis (Python, R, SQL)
✅ Geospatial Technologies (QGIS, ArcGIS, Neo4j)
✅ Web Development & Database Management (Streamlit, Flask, PostgreSQL, Neo4j)

I am passionate about building intelligent tools to solve real-world challenges in AI, environmental sustainability, and geospatial data science.
