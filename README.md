- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KaziNafiulHassan
- ðŸ‘€ I am an environmental engineer with a focus on data analysis, geospatial technologies, and database management. Currently, as a Research Assistant at Helmholtz-Zentrum fÃ¼r Umweltforschung GmbH-UFZ, I enhance
CleanGeoStreamR functionality and optimize Neo4j graph databases using Python. My work integrates large-scale environmental data with advanced visualization tools to assess chemical risks across Europe. With strong expertise
in Python, Neo4j, GIS, and hydrology, I bring a unique blend of technical and environmental knowledge, making me well-suited for roles that bridge data science and environmental analysis.
